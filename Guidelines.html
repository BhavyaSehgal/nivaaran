      Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people.
      Here are the basics of how to wear a mask:

      Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you take it off.
      Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin.
      Here are some specifics on what type of mask to wear and when, depending on how much virus is circulating where you live, where you go and who you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wear a fabric mask unless you’re in a particular risk group. This is especially important when you can’t stay physically distanced,
      particularly in crowded and poorly ventilated indoor settings.
      Wear a medical/surgical mask if you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Are over 60,</li>
      <li> Have underlying medical conditions,</li>
      <li> Are feeling unwell, and/or</li>
      <li> Are looking after an ill family member.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For health workers, medical masks are essential personal protective equipment when engaging with patients with suspected,
      probable or confirmed COVID-19. Respirator masks (such as FFP2, FFP3, N95, N99) should be used in settings where procedures generating aerosols are performed
      and must be fitted to ensure the right size is worn.

    <p>
      Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after
      blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.If you don’t have soap or water, use an alcohol‐based hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent
      alcohol. Avoid close contact with people who are sick and stay home when you’re sick.
